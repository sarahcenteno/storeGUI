# storeGUI
This is a java program I developed for my Enterprise Computing course. In this program, I created a GUI application for a book store that lets the user to add books that are listed in the inventory text file to the shopping cart. Once the user is done adding all the books he/she wants to purchase, the program will calculate the total cost with tax and print a receipt for the user. Then, the program will print that transaction to an output file called "transaction.txt".

# Getting Started
Once the user has the GUI opened, the user will enter the number of books he/she would like to buy for the whole order. Then, the user will enter the Book ID from the inventory.txt file. After, the user will enter the number of books he/she would like to buy for the Book ID he/she entered. Then, the user will click on the "Process Item" button and the book info and subtotal will print in the "Item Info" and "Subtotal" text fields. Then, the user will click on the "Confirm Item" button. The user will repeat the previous steps if he/she wants to buy other books. If the user wants to view what they have added to their cart, they can click on the "View Order" button. If the user is done adding books to their shopping cart, they can click on the "Finish Order" button. If they want to erase their order and start from scratch, they can click on the "New Order" button. If the user wants to exit out of the GUI, they can click on the "Exit" button.
